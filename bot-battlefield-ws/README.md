# 🐤 TP WebSocket Part 3

**🌐 App and Socket**

You develop an `Socket` application in `PHP Symfony` with `Ratchet` which is extotic and a `Component Based Application` in `JavaScript native` which is ambitious, a third server providing endpoints have been developped in `PHP Native`. The TP aims to continue the project by adding `buisness logic` to the `server socket` and rely it with the `APP`.
> The design was important to master the scaling up of projects.

## 📦 Sprint Backlog

> 📺 Previouly the team achieve some valuables stories:

Logged players only can rely on a socket server, they are notified when an other player connect him self and when he disconnect. Players can select an other player for ask him to play then they are retired from the selectionable players. A player can cancel an invitation and release the other, either when he disconnect.

👪 `Scrum team` have the following stories to do:

* 📚 `stories`
    * [✔️] *As player i want to ask a player for play with me to start playing with someone I choose*
    * [✔️] *As player i want to cancel a proposal to start playing with someone else*
    * [✔️] *As a player, I do not want to be among the free players to play after a proposal so as not to be solicited when I ask someone to play*
    * [✔️] *As a player, when I close the application during a proposal, I want the chosen player to no longer be able to answer my solicitation so that he does not wait unnecessarily*
    * 🔥 As a **solicited player**, i want to refuse a game and notify from my response to can wait for an other proposal
    * 💣 As a **solicited player**, when I close the application i want to notify the chosen player from my disconnection so that he does not wait unnecessarily
    * 🎆 As a **solicited player** i want to accept a proposal of game to start to play
